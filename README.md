# FitRec-P3
A multi-level deep learning approach that extracts insightful fitness 
recommendations from a large-scale real fitness dataset gathered from wearable IoT 
devices. Our model uses machine learning techniques to accurately estimate speed
sequence, distance and heart rate sequence based on personalized fitness profiles. We use 
a convolution neural network (CNN) to separate out the individual components of the 
running profile, allowing us to more accurately predict and recommend training goals.
